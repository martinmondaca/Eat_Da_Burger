  ## Description

  The motivation for this project was the desire to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Paradigm to create an application. This application uses an Express server with a MySQL database. The application retrieves information from the database to display in the app. New data can be added to the database and updated, as well. The information in the database is dynamically displayed using Handlebars.

  The purpose of this application is to let users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. When a burger is added it shows up on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured. The user can then devour each burger and it will then show up on the right side of the page.
